              Hi, I'm Mikoto — I'm a content creator and IT sales expert based
              in Amsterdam.

          <p class="about-details">
            I'm passionate about two things—traveling and technology. As a
            travel YouTuber, I document my adventures through vlogs, sharing my
            experiences from various corners of the world. Whether I'm exploring
            a hidden gem abroad or giving a glimpse into life in Amsterdam, I
            aim to inspire others to embark on their own journeys. My channel is
            a blend of destination highlights, travel tips, and authentic
            day-to-day moments, allowing my audience to experience different
            cultures and places through my lens. I love connecting with my
            viewers, providing insights and recommendations that can make their
            trips unforgettable.
          </p>
          <p class="about-details">
            Alongside my love for travel, I work in IT sales and use my
            expertise to help businesses solve technical problems and grow their
            digital presence. Whether you're in need of tech solutions, content
            creation guidance, or a well-planned trip, I'm here to assist!
